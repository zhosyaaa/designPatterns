This project is a demonstration of how to use design patterns in Golang. The project is a simple banking application that allows users to create accounts, make payments, and view transactions.

The project is structured using the following design patterns:

* Factory: The CurrencyService and TransactionFactory classes use the factory pattern to create instances of different currency services and transaction types.
* Dependency injection: The CurrencyService and TransactionFactory classes use dependency injection to inject the dependencies they need.
* Adapter: The CurrencyClientAdapter class uses the adapter pattern to adapt the CurrencyClient interface to the CurrencyService interface.
* Decorator: The BalanceCheckingDecorator and CurrencyConversionDecorator classes use the decorator pattern to add additional functionality to the Payment interface.
